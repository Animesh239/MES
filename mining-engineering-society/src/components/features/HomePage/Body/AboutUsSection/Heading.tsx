        The Mining Engineering Society (MES) is the official student body of the
        Department of Mining Engineering at NIT Rourkela. Guided by our faculty,
        MES serves as a dynamic platform where students organize and participate
        in a wide range of technical, cultural, and professional activities
        throughout the year. Our flagship event is MINARE, the annual Geo-Mining
        Fest of NIT Rourkela.
